These were the tasks that were assigned by RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY , During their CPP INTERNSHIP.

1] First Task was -

Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

The Program is Labled as - NGGame.cpp


2] Second Task was -

Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

The Program is Labled as - Calculator.cpp

3] Third Task was -
